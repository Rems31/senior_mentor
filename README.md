Website developed during Le Wagon bootcamp in team of three. The goal of this site was to create an Airbnb clone, but with an original idea. So we started by renting services provided by seniors, such as gardening, cooking, sewing, and storytelling lessons like our grandparents did. 
Website developed in Ruby on Rails, using HTML, CSS, SQL, and deployed on Heroku.
